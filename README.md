## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

• I learned how to use and operate JSON and transform it in a JS array list to use in my JS code.
• I learned how to insert the JS array list data in the html fields properly using "loop for" and "switch case".

It was a very challenge for a JavaScript newbie student.


### Useful resources

- [B7 Web](https://www.b7web.com.br) - B7Web is an online web developer course from Brazil. So i learned how to write HTML and CSS codes studying B7Web's classes.
